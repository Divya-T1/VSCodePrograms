/*
Type: Defines a set of possible values and a set of operations for an object
Object: Holds a value of a given type. Objects are stored at specific addresses (locations) in the computer's memory (gets a unique address each time the program is run despite value being the same)
Ex: int x=5 and int y=5 get their own "box" since they are separate objects, and they get their own address (Shorcut: only get a specific address and box if variable type is first declared)
Variable: the name of an object

int -> Whole # between -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648

double -> A # with 15 or less digits
bool - true (1) or false (0)
char -> equals #s that correlate to a specific character or set equal to a single character
